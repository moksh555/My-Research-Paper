Cardio-Vascular Risk Detection System using Different Machine Learning Techniques
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. This project focuses on developing a patient-level risk detection system using classical machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into "risky" or "non-risky" categories based on clinical indicators.

Abstract
Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most cardiovascular conditions, progresses silently and is often detected too late. Early identification through machine learning can guide timely medical intervention. This research performs extensive experimentation on different classification models and achieves a 98% recognition accuracy using a Decision Tree Classifier.

Dataset
Approximately 1,500 anonymized patient records

Key features:

Age, Gender

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

ECG Results

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise-Induced Angina

Blood Sugar Levels

Target label: Cardiovascular risk (binary)

⚙️ Machine Learning Models
Decision Tree (Best, 98% accuracy)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Methodology
Data preprocessing (standardization, label encoding)

Train-test split with stratification

Cross-validation (10-fold)

Model tuning and comparative evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Results & Impact
Decision Tree model achieved the highest performance.

Enables patients to detect risk early and follow preventive routines.

Suitable for integration into diagnostic tools, hospital systems, or mobile health apps.
