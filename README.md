# This repository contains documentation, and summaries for two of my IEEE published research papers in the domain of medical machine learning. Both works focus on the early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using different approaches, one with classical machine learning models and the other with neural networks and big data infrastructure.
# The goal of these projects is to demonstrate how predictive analytics and artificial intelligence can be applied to real-world healthcare problems to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

# 1. Cardio-Vascular Risk Detection System using Different Machine Learning Techniques
## DOI: 10.1109/iSSSC56467.2022.10051216

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. This project focuses on developing a patient-level risk detection system using classical machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into "risky" or "non-risky" categories based on clinical indicators.

## Abstract

Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most cardiovascular conditions, progresses silently and is often detected too late. Early identification through machine learning can guide timely medical intervention. This research performs extensive experimentation on different classification models and achieves a 98% recognition accuracy using a Decision Tree Classifier.
